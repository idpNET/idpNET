I'm a passionate individual with a deep interest in programming, machineries, and electronics. 
Always curious and eager to learn, I'm currently on an exciting journey of exploring various topics and expanding my knowledge in the world of technology.

I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on back-end projects. If you have an exciting venture or an open-source project that aligns with my interests, I'd be thrilled to contribute my skills and ideas.
